This directory contains the version 0.1b release of the CPlant compile
environment.  It includes the C, C++, FORTRAN 77, and FORTRAN 90 compile
scripts, as well as the include files and libraries needed for building
a CPlant application.

In addition, this directory contains man pages for the compilers as well
as man pages for some of the CPlant utilities.

The compile environment should work on any Digital UNIX machine which
has the corresponding Digital UNIX compilers installed.  Each compile
script contains an environment variable, CPLANT_PATH, which needs to be
set to the location where the compile envrionment is installed.  For
example, if the compile environment is installed in /usr/local/cplant,
the compile scripts in the bin subdirectory should be modified so that
line 9 is 'CPLANT_PATH=${CPLANT_PATH-/usr/local/cplant}'.

If you encounter any problems with this compile environment, send mail to
cplant-help@cs.sandia.gov.
