Cplant Software Release 0.6 - February 9, 2001
----------------------------------------------

This release of Cplant software adds enhanced error correction and detection
protocols to the Myrinet message passing software and adds ASCI/Red-style
job logging capability.  The enhanced error correction/detection code in the
RTS/CTS module will now recover from a small set of network errors.  Previous
versions of Cplant software were unable to recover from any Myrinet network
errors, such as header or data corruption errors.  A new reliability protcol
within the RTS/CTS module can now recover from such errors.  This release
also allows for ASCI/Red-style logging of jobs so that the tools used for
processing ASCI/Red log files are compatible with the Cplant clusters.

Highlights
----------
- Limited Myrinet error correctin/detection protocol
- ASCI/Red-style logging information

Bug Fixes
---------
- Various fixes to Portals 3.0 bugs.  The enhanced error correction/detection
  protocol uncovered some bugs in the Portals 3.0 library code.  For example,
  some message passing events appeared to be generated out of order due to
  the way the Portals 3.0 library code was allocating event entries.
