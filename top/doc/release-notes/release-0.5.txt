Cplant Software Release 0.5 - June 22, 2000
-------------------------------------------

This release of Cplant software makes great strides in improving the
reliability and stability of the runtime environment, especially in
the area of message passing.  The release contains the next generation
of a scalable message passing layer designed specifically for the
architecture of a PC cluster, Portals 3.0.  The new design has led to
increased robustness as well as increased message passing performance.
The release also contains a port of the latest version of the MPICH
implementation of MPI on top of Portals 3.0.  This new implementation
uses a standard two-level protocol that addresses some of the
limitations of the previous MPI implementation.  This release has
undergone more stringent testing than any previous releases of Cplant
system software.  A four-phase approach to testing that covered basic
MPI functionality, application micro-benchmarks, several real
applications, and system stress tests (ported from ASCI Red) was used.
The release was contingent upon satisfactory completion of this suite.
More information and documentation on these features will be available
at the Cplant web site:

Highlights
----------
- Portals 3.0 (kernel module implementation)
- MPICH 1.2.0 over Portals 3.0
- PBS 2.2

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bug in Portals 2.0 buffer touching code
- Fixed copy-on-write bug in bebopd and PCT
- Fixed bug in RTS/CTS where send-side resources were not getting
  freed when a message was aborted
- Enhanced RTS/CTS so that user process gets a SIGPIPE when a receive
  or send touches memory that the process does not own
- Fixed a bug with using 'copy_to_user()'
- Enhanced RTS/CTS by sending a SIGPIPE to a process whose buffer is
  corrupt due to a lost packet

Tests
-----
- MPICH MPI tests
- Various developer MPI tests
- NAS Parallel Benchmarks version 2.3
- Applications: Granflow, MPSalsa, Zapotec (CTH and Pronto), Alegra,
                Ladera, LAMPS

Known Problems
--------------
- Alegra encounters message corruption after several hours of running.
- In heavily congested network situations, it is possible for packet loss 
  to occur. This can result in an application being terminated due to
  MPI message truncation errors or floating point errors due to erroneous
  data. It is also possible for the application to hang in an MPI 
  collective operation. The Cplant team has identified the cause of this
  problem and is working on a resolution.
- Some applications on Alaska and Siberia have had trouble obtaining 
  consistent runtimes. A problem with the Linux klogd and syslogd logging
  daemons has been identified. The Cplant team is presently testing a 
  new version of these daemons and will update the machines if they
  resolve the problem. If not, these daemons will be turned off.
