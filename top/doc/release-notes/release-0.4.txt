Cplant Software Release 0.4 - November 22, 1999
----------------------------------------------

This release of Cplant software adds support for the Portable Batch System
(PBS) queueing system, and also includes support for extending the parallel I/O
capabilities of a cluster.  PBS has been integrated into the Cplant runtime
environment to provide a queueing system that can be used to submit and monitor
batch jobs.  The parallel I/O capabilities have been extended to include an I/O
proxy mechanism that uses a third party vendor cluster filesystem (current
SGI's CXFS on Alaska).  We have also upgraded the Cplant software to support
version 2.2.10 of the Linux kernel.  This upgrade was required to support the
FY99 Cplant hardware, Compaq XP1000 workstations.  580 of these workstations
running Cplant software achieved 247.6 GFLOPS on MPLINPACK, which is #40 on the
November 1999 list of the Top 500 supercomputers in the world.  More
information and documentation on these features will be available at the
following Cplant web site:
