Cplant Software Release 0.3 - August 19, 1999
---------------------------------------------

This release of Cplant software enables independent parallel I/O and
contains several bug fixes that increase the reliability of the system
and help identify failing components.  Users can now access
independent filesystems residing on different RAIDS.  Access to each
RAID is provided by fyod, a daemon process running on the I/O nodes.
Application programs can expect to see 15-20 MB/s I/O bandwidth per
individual RAID. For more information on using the parallel I/O
capabilities, see

Highlights
----------
- Indpendent parallel I/O capability
- Increased message passing reliablity
- New showmesh_tk tool for system management
- Backtrace available from hung processes
- Suppression of Fortran runtime library error messages


Bug Fixes
---------
- Unreliable message passing
  o MPI communication errors (hung nodes)
  o Application load errors (unsuccessful loads, hung nodes)
- Yod node list processing
- Compile scripts allow quoted arguments


System Software Developer Tests
-------------------------------
- NAS Parallel Benchmarks version 2.3 Class A up to 256 nodes
- MPLinpack benchmark on 310 nodes
- All to All bit error tests on 310 nodes
- Application tests on 256 nodes


Application Tests
-----------------
- MPI Communication tests
  o Parallel "Hello, world"
  o Ping pong
  o Repeated broadcast
  o Sparse matrix-vector multiply
  o Molecular dynamics exchange

- Application libraries
  o BLAS
