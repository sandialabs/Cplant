    <bf/PCT/ &mdash Process Control Thread
    </p>



<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/pct/

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    The <bf/PCT/ (Process Control Thread) is a process running on
    each compute node of the Cplant.  The <bf/PCT/ accepts the
    parallel application executable image from yod and starts the 
    user process.  The <bf/PCT/ can respond to bebopd requests
    for status information about it's state and about the user
    process it is hosting.
    </p>

<sect1> OPTIONS
    <p>
    <descrip>

    <tag/-nid <it/node-number/ -pid <it/portal-id//
	<p>
	The <bf/PCT/ normally registers with the bebopd managing the
	virtual machine.  If an alternative bebopd is running for test
	purposes in addition to the regular bebopd, and you wish this
	<bf/PCT/ to register with the alternative bebopd, then provide
	the node number and portal ID of that bebopd with these
	arguments.
	</p>

    <tag/-D/
	<p>
	This option causes the <bf/PCT/ to output information about
	what it is doing.  Repeating the <it/-D/ option on the command
	line increases the amount of information.
	Normally the information goes to the log file (/var/log/cplant)
	on the compute node.  This can be changed with the <it/-S/
	and <it/-L/ options.
	</p>


    <tag/-daemon/
	<p>
        By default the PCT runs as a foreground process.  Use <it/-d/ to
	run it in the background.
	</p>

    <tag/-S &lsqb;0&verbar;1&rsqb
	<p>
	The <bf/PCT/ outputs warnings and errors, and, if the
	<it/-D/ option is used, status information.
	The <it/0/ switch turns off all output from the <bf/PCT/ to stderr.
	The <it/1/ switch turns it on.  By default, the <bf/PCT/ <it/does not/
	write to stderr.
	</p>

    <tag/-L &lsqb;0&verbar;1&rsqb
	<p>
	The <bf/PCT/ outputs warnings and errors, and, if the
	<it/-D/ option is used, status information.
	The <it/0/ switch turns off all output from the <bf/PCT/ to the
	log file.
	The <it/1/ switch turns it on.  By default, the <bf/PCT/ <it/does/
	write to log file.
	</p>

    </descrip>

<sect1> ERRORS
    <p>
     The <bf/PCT/ reports error conditions in the log file (/var/log/cplant).
     It will not exit unless the error makes it impossible for the <bf/PCT/
     to do it's job, for example if it has no memory to allocate a portal.
     Errors in loading applications are reported back to yod.

<sect1> SIGNALS
    <p>
On receiving a SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2, the <bf/PCT/ will log the routine it
is in now, what routines it was in most recently, and the state of the 
application process it is hosting.  It will also display a loop counter,
which should increment on subsequent displays, indicating whether the
PCT is stuck somewhere or has been progressing through it's main service
loop.
    </p>
    <p>
On receiving a SIGHUP, the <bf/PCT/ will close and reopen it's log file,
re-read the site file, and re-read the cplant-host file and send a status
update to the bebopd listed there.
