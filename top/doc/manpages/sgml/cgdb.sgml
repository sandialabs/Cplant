<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/cgdb/ &mdash Debug (from the service node) a process of a Cplant parallel application
    </p>



<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/cgdb -n / <it/nodeNum/
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    <bf/cgdb/ allows you to debug a single process of a parallel application.  You run
    it on the service node and it communicates with the Gnu debugger <bf/gdb/ on
    the compute node.
    </p>
    <p>
To use this feature, run yod with the <it/-attach/ option.  This
will display the nodes the application has been allocated and
will start a debugging session on each compute node.
yod will prompt you before
it allows the application processes to procede to user code.
    </p>

    <p>
To start a debugging proxy on the service node which can attach
to the debugger on a compute node, run <bf/cgdb/ with a physical
node number from the yod display:
    </p>

    <p><code>
    cgdb -n 24
    </code></p>


    <p>
Now you can enter gdb commands to debug the application process.
    </p>
