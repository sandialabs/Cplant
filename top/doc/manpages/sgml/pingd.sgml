<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/pingd/ &mdash 
The all-purpose interface to the node allocator and compute node
PCTs.  It displays status of a running parallel application,
and interrupts or kills your parallel application.  Plus for
administrators only: reserves nodes,
kills PCTs, notifies bebopd of death of PCT, changes bebopd level of PBS support
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    By default, <bf/pingd/ ("ping the daemon") contacts 
    a bebopd (the Cplant node allocator daemon)
    and obtains and displays information 
    about the status of compute nodes and the jobs they are running.  
    System administrators can use the <it/kill/ function of <bf/pingd/ to 
    kill PCTs (the Cplant compute node daemons),
    or the <it/gone/ function to notify the bebopd that a PCT is dead.
The <it/reset/ function allows users to kill their jobs (with a SIGKILL
to every compute node process)
and reset the compute nodes hosting their jobs to FREE status.
The <it/interrupt/ function allows users to interrupt their jobs
with a SIGTERM to every compute node process.
System administrators can reset or interrupt any compute node.
    </p>

<sect1> OPTIONS
    <p>
    <descrip>

    <tag/-all/
	<p>
	Perform requested operation (like query, reset, interrupt) on all nodes
        in the compute partition.  This is the default.  To limit the operation,
	use <it/-list/, <it/-job/, <it/-pbsjob/ or <it/-mine/.
	</p>


    <tag/-fast/
	<p>
	By default, the bebopd queries all compute nodes for their status before
	reporting back to <bf/pingd/ (unless it queried them all "very recently").  
	For a faster display, <it/-fast/
	queries the bebopd for it's most recent update from the compute 
        partition.
	</p>



    <tag/-gone/
	<p>
        It is possible that a PCT can terminate without notifying the 
	bebopd.  Use <it/-gone/ to notify the bebopd that a PCT has
	disappeared from a node.

    <tag/-help/
    <tag/-xtrahelp/
	<p>
        Display a list of <bf/pingd/ options and how to use them.  <it/-xtrahelp/
        provides a more verbose message.
	</p>

    <tag/-interrupt/
	<p>
Send a SIGTERM to the parallel application on each specified node.
System administrators can interrupt any application.
Users can only interrupt their own jobs.
	</p>

    <tag/-job <it/job-ID//
    <tag/-pbsjob <it/job-ID//
	<p>
	Limit the function to compute nodes running job number <it/job-ID/.
A PBS (Portable Batch System) job may start several Cplant parallel
applications.  The job as a whole has a PBS job ID, and each application
has a Cplant job ID.  Use the <it/-pbsjob/ option to specify a PBS job
ID, and use the <it/-job/ option to specify a single Cplant parallel
application.

	</p>

    <tag/-kill/
	<p>
	System administrators can kill PCTs with this option.
	</p>

    <tag/-list <it/node-list//
	<p>
	Perform the requested operation on the specified list of nodes.  
        Node specifiers are delimited by commas.  A node specifier is a 
        physical node number or
	a node range.  A node range is specified by two physical 
        node numbers separated
	by one or more dots.  No white space may be included in 
        the <it/node-list/.
	Actually, the <it/node-list/ may be specified without the <it/-list/
        option specifier.  If pingd finds something on it's argument line
	without an option specifier
	that can be parsed as a node-list, it will assume it's a node-list.
	</p>


    <tag/-mine/
	<p>
	Perform function on compute nodes running my jobs only.
	</p>

    <tag/-nid <it/node-number//
    <tag/-pid <it/portal-ID//
        <p>
        These arguments will cause <bf/pingd/ to contact the bebopd on the specified
        node number and at the specified portal ID rather than the bebopd listed
        in the <tt/cplant-host/ file.  This option is only for testing
        alternative bebopds and should probably be used only by Cplant developers.
        </p>


    <tag/-NoInquire/
	<p>
Normally pingd displays an "are you sure" sort of prompt before
interrupting, resetting or killing nodes.  Use the NoInquire
option to make pingd skip this step.
	</p>

    <tag/-parse/
	<p>
	This option causes pingd to list it's output in an easily parseable format.
	</p>

    <tag/-PBSsupport &lsqb;on&verbar;off&rsqb /
    <tag/-PBSupdate &lsqb;on&verbar;off&rsqb /
        <p>
PBS (Portal Batch System) can rely on the Cplant bebopd node allocator
to tell it how many live compute nodes are in the machine.  This number
may change if nodes crash or if non-PBS jobs complete sometime after
PBS has started managing the machine.  The bebopd is running in
PBSsupport mode if it is keeping track of the number of live compute
nodes in the machine and policing PBS users to ensure they use no more
nodes than they were allocated.  The bebopd is running in PBSupdate mode
if in addition it sends updates to the PBS server whenever the number
of live compute nodes changes.  These two arguments can be used to
turn on or off PBSsupport and to turn on or off PBSupdate.
Since PBSupdate implies PBSsupport, turning on
PBSupdate automatically turns on PBSsupport, turning off PBSsupport
automatically turns off PBSupdate.
	</p>

     <tag/-PBSinteractive <it/n//
        <p>
The bebopd can reserve <it/n/ nodes for interactive use.  PBS will
not be able to schedule these nodes for batch jobs.  This option sends
a request to the bebopd to reserve <it/n/ nodes for interactive use.
	</p>

    <tag/-reserve <it/user-ID//
	<p>
System adminstrators can reserve a node for a particular user with this
    option.  The argument is either a user name or numeric user ID.
    The bebopd will allow a job running on the node to complete, but
    will refuse to allocate the node to anyone other than the specified user.
    To free the node, use the <it/-unreserve/ option.  This option should
    only be used to debug troubled nodes.  Taking nodes away can cause
    jobs to fail when jobs are being scheduled by PBS.
	</p>

    <tag/-reset/
	<p>
	Reset the selected nodes.  This option kills the application
	process (with SIGKILL), and resets the PCT to available status.  System
	administrators can reset any node.  Users can only reset
	nodes running their jobs.
	</p>

    <tag/-summary/
        <p>
Rather than displaying a line per node, just display the totals.
        </p>

    <tag/-unreserve/
	<p>
Use this option to free a node that has been reserved for a particular
user.  A job running on the node will not be disturbed.
	</p>

    <tag/-verbose/
	<p>
	Display extra information about running jobs.  You will not
	see this information about other people's jobs unless you
	are a very special user.
	</p>

    </descrip>

<sect1> EXAMPLES
    <p>
     <bf/pingd/ assumes the most restrictive interpretation of which nodes
     are specified.  If you provide a list of node numbers, a job ID, and
     specify <bf/-mine/, <bf/pingd/ will perform the operation on the
     nodes in the list which are running the job specified, if you own it.
    </p>
    <p>
    To list the current status of all nodes in the compute partition:
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd 
    </code></p>

    <p>
    To list the status most recently reported to the service partition
    of all nodes in the compute partition (without going out and querying
    the compute parition):
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd -fast
    </code></p>

    <p>
    To kill the PCT on node 20:
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd -kill -l 20
    </code></p>

    <p>
    To reset the PCTs on nodes 0 through 100 which are running my jobs, either
    of these will work.  (The <it/-l/ option specifier may be omitted when 
    specifying a node list.)
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd -reset -l 0..100 -mine
    pingd -reset 0..100 -mine
    </code></p>

    <p>
    To display much status information about my jobs:
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd -m -v
    </code></p>

    <p>
    To inform the bebopd that the PCTs on nodes 55, 56, 57 and 61 are dead:
    </p>
    <p><code>
    pingd -gone -l 55..57,61
    </code></p>

<sect1> ERRORS
    <p>
    Some compute nodes may be slow to respond to your request, and <bf/pingd/
    does not wait for them.  This is not an error.  Run <bf/pingd/ again
    with the <it/-fast/ option to get the updates which arrived at the bebopd
    (service node daemon)
    after your <bf/pingd/ display.  (Running without <it/-fast/ would cause the
    bebopd to go out and query all the compute nodes again.)
