<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/site file/ &mdash Cplant site configuration file
    </p>



<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
Certain runtime configuration information required by yod, pct, and
bebopd can be set up in a text file.  
For every item that can be defined in the site file, there is also an
environment variable that can define this item, and there is a default
coded into the Cplant utilities and daemons.  Definition of the items
at runtime procedes like this:
 
<itemize>
<item>
  If there is an environment value defining the item, this is the value
  used.
 
<item>
  Else if there is a definition in the site file, this is the value used.
 
<item>
  Else the default coded into the utilities and daemons is used.
</itemize>
 
    <p>
The format of the site file is to list the environment variable name
followed by the definition of the environment variable.
 
    <p>
Values that can be defined in the site file or by way of environment
variables are the following:
 
<descrip>
<tag/PCT_SCRATCH/
    <p> 
    The path name to a directory in RAM disk on the compute nodes where
    the PCT will store the user's executable.
    Default: /tmp/pct-scratch
 
<tag/PCT_OVERFLOW/
 
    <p> 
    The path name to local disk on the compute node where the PCT can
    store user executables that don't fit in RAM disk.  A value <tt>none</tt>
    tells the PCT there is no disk storage for user executables.
    Default: none
 
<tag/LOGFILENAME/
 
    <p> 
    The pathname from the service node to the user log file written by
    yod.
    Default: /tmp/userlog
 
<tag/VM_NAME_FILE/
 
    <p> 
    The pathname (from compute and service nodes) to a text file containing
    the name of the current virtual machine.
    Default: /cplant/etc/vmname

<tag/PBS_PREFIX/
 
    <p> 
    The location of the <it/bin/ and <it/sbin/ directories containing PBS
    executables.
    Default: /

</descrip>
 
    <p> 
The following values are used by yod when it tries to load an executable
that is too large to fit in the compute node RAM disk.  yod instead copies
the executable to the SSS1, and then uses the SUID yod\_site\_priv to rsh
to SSS1 and rcp the executable to the SSS0's on SUs which contain compute
nodes of the job.  yod tells the PCTs the pathname to these copies of the
executable and the PCTs exec them from there.  (If all the compute nodes
of the job are in one SU, then yod just copies the executable to the SSS1
and tells the PCTs to exec it from there.)
 
A <tt>%s</tt> in these definitions is replaced at runtime with the virtual machine
name.
 
<descrip>
<tag/VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE/
 
    <p> 
    The path name on the SSS1 to a directory where the executable will be
    stored.
    Default: /usr/local/%s
 
<tag/VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE_FROM_SRV_NODE/
 
    <p> 
    The path name to VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the service nodes.
    Default: /etc/local
 
<tag/SU_GLOBAL_STORAGE/
 
    <p> 
    The path name on the SSS0 to a directory where the executable will
    be stored.
    Default: /cplant/nfs-cplant
 
<tag/LOCAL_EXEC_PATH/
 
    <p> 
    The path name to SU_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the compute node.
    Default: /cplant
 
<tag/SINGLE_LEVEL_GLOBAL_STORAGE/
 
    <p> 
    The path name to global storage on the SSS1 from the service nodes.
    If all the compute nodes of a job are in one SU, a single copy of
    the executable will be made by yod to the directory on the SSS1.
    Default: /etc/local
 
<tag/SINGLE_LEVEL_LOCAL_EXEC_PATH/
 
    <p> 
    The path name to SINGLE_LEVEL_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the compute nodes.
    Default: /usr/local/%s
 
<tag/SU_NAME_FORMAT/
 
    <p> 
    At runtime, an SU machine name is formed by replacing <tt>%d</tt> in this
    format with the SU number.  It is the machine name used in the rcp
    from the SSS1 to the SSS0.
    Default: z-%d
 
<tag/VM_GLOBAL_MACHINE/
 
    <p> 
    The machine name of the SSS1, for yod's rsh from the service node.
    Default: alaska-sss1-0
</descrip>
 
    <p>
The default location of the site file is <tt>/etc/local/site</tt>.  This can be
overridden at runtime with the environment variable SITE_FILE.
