<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    The <bf/bebopd/ daemon runs in the service partition.  It is the
    point in the Cplant where knowledge of compute node status resides.
    It has the following interfaces:

    <p>
    <descrip>
    <tag/PCTs/
    <p> 
      The <bf/bebopd/ receives messages
       from the compute node PCTs when they start and end, and when an
       application terminates.  If the 
       <bf/bebopd/ is restarted,
       it contacts the PCTs to identify itself to them.  The <bf/bebopd/
       sends status queries as needed to the PCTs and maintains the
       responses.
    </p> 
    <tag/yod/
    <p> 
    The <bf/bebopd/ accepts yod requests on behalf of 
    users wishing to run a parallel
    application.  The <bf/bebopd/ attempts to allocate to the job 
    the requested nodes, and assigns a numeric job ID to the application.
    </p> 
    <tag/pingd/
    <p> 
    It also accepts pingd requests for updates from the compute partition,
    and returns pingd a list of compute node status information.  It
    accepts requests from pingd to send a SIGTERM
    or a SIGKILL to an application, kill PCTs, or to
    note that a PCT it thought was out there is gone.  The bebopd may also
    receive requests from pingd to turn on or off PBSsupport or PBSupdate,
    or to change the number of nodes reserved for interactive (i.e. non-PBS) use.
    </p>

    <tag/PBS server/
    <p>
    When the bebopd is run in PBSupdate mode, it updates the PBS server
    whenever the number of live compute nodes changes.  That is, it
    uses the PBS qmgr client to keep the resources_available.size and
    resources_max.size attributes of the PBS server accurate.
    </p>

    </descrip>

    <p>
    The <bf/bebopd/ as designed today exists as a single process on one
    node of the service partition.  The plan
    is to run <bf/bebopd/ as a distributed service across the service partition,
    both in the interest of fault tolerance and to improve response
    time to yod and pingd users.
    </p>

<sect1> OPTIONS
    <p>
    <descrip>

    <tag/-alternative/
	<p>
	Every portals process has a portal ID.  It is this ID that the
	portals module uses when dispatching received messages to processes.
	For testing purposes we may want to
	run another bebopd on the same node. 
	This argument causes the <bf/bebopd/ to request an unused portal ID from the
	portals module.  The bebopd will display it's alternative portal ID on 
        startup.
	</p>

    <tag/-D/
	<p>
	This option causes the <bf/bebopd/ to output information about
	what it is doing.  Repeating the <it/-D/ option on the command
	line increases the amount of information.
	</p>

    <tag/-S &lsqb;0&verbar;1&rsqb
        <p>
        The <bf/bebopd/ outputs warnings and errors, and, if the
        <it/-D/ option is used, status information.
        The <it/0/ switch turns off all output from the <bf/bebopd/ to stderr.
        The <it/1/ switch turns it on.  By default, the <bf/bebopd/ <it/does not/
        write to stderr.
        </p>
 
    <tag/-L &lsqb;0&verbar;1&rsqb
        <p>
        The <bf/bebopd/ outputs warnings and errors, and, if the
        <it/-D/ option is used, status information.
        The <it/0/ switch turns off all output from the <bf/bebopd/ to the
        log file.
        The <it/1/ switch turns it on.  By default, the <bf/bebopd/ <it/does/
        write to log file.
        </p>


    <tag/-r <it/optional-file-name//
	<p>
	This option specifies that the <bf/bebopd/ is being restarted.
	The <bf/bebopd/ always saves a file (<tt/saved_pct_list/ in the
	same directory as the bebopd registry file)
	containing a list of active
	PCTs when it exits.  When <bf/bebopd/ restarts, it reads in
	this file and contacts the PCTs for their status.  If an
	<it/optional-file-name/ is given, the bebopd will look there
	for the PCT list instead of in the <tt/saved_pct_list/ file.
	</p>

    <tag/-help/
        <p>
	This option displays the list of bebopd options.
	</p>

    <tag/-daemon/
        <p>
	This option runs the bebopd in the background.  The default is to
	run the bebopd as a foreground process.
	</p>

    <tag/-PBSsupport/
    <tag/-PBSupdate/
	<p>
PBS (Portal Batch System) on Cplant requires support from the bebopd.
The bebopd is running in
PBSsupport mode if it is keeping track of the number of live compute
nodes in the machine and policing PBS users to ensure they use no more
nodes than they were allocated.  The bebopd is running in PBSupdate mode
if in addition it sends updates to the PBS server whenever the number
of live compute nodes changes.  These two arguments can be used to
turn on PBSsupport or to turn on PBSupdate.
Since PBSupdate implies PBSsupport, turning on
PBSupdate automatically turns on PBSsupport.
	</p>

    <tag/-PBSlist <it/node,list//
	<p>
The bebopd can reserve \fInumNodes\fP nodes for interactive use.  PBS will
not be able to schedule these nodes for batch jobs.  Specify the list
of interactive nodes here (ie- 23,45..78,99).
	</p>

    </descrip>

<sect1> ERRORS
    <p>
    Errors and warnings are logged to /var/log/cplant on the node hosting
    the bebopd.
    </p>
	
<sect1> SIGNALS
    <p>
On receiving a SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2, the bebopd will write to the log file
it's identifying information and what routine it is in.
On receiving a SIGHUP, the bebopd will close and reopen it's log file,
list identifying information to the log file, and re-read the site file.
    </p>

<sect1> FILES
    <p><descrip>

        <p>
         This file defines site specific information that may be required
         by the <bf/bebopd/.
    <tag>/var/log/cplant</tag>
        <p>
         This is the log file where Cplant daemons and utilities log
         status.
