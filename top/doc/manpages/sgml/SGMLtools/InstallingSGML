We're using the Linux SGML tools with the QWERTS format from
thomas.gordon@gmd.de. We're also relying on groff and RosettaMan from
ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z

In addition we slitghtly modified the qwertz DTD and have our own rep
file (pumaman).

Assuming RosettaMan and groff are installed, here is how to install
the SGML tools plus our own changes:



Get ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/sgml-tools-0.99.20.tar.gz
Do an install:
    anika -->>./install 
    Installing SGML-Tools:
    Where do you want the SGML-Tools binaries?
    [/usr/local/bin] 
    Where do you want the SGML-Tools library and support files?
    [/usr/local/lib/sgml-tools] 
    Where do you want the SGML-Tools documentation?
    [/usr/local/doc/sgml-tools] 
    Where do you want the SGMl-Tools man pages?
    [/usr/local/man/man1] 
    Where is perl?
    [/usr/local/bin/perl] /bin/perl
    What optimization flags would you like to use?
    [-O] 

The following files and directory are part of Cplant/top/doc/man/sgml/SGMLtools:

cp qwertz.dtd  /usr/local/lib/sgml-tools/dtd/
cp -r  qwertz /usr/local/lib/sgml-tools/rep
cp  format /usr/local/bin
