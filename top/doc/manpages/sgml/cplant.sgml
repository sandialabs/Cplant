<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/cplant/ &mdash Cplant startup script
    </p>

<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/cplant/ start|stop|restart
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION<p>
    <bf/cplant/ is the script in the init.d/ directory which is used
    to start or stop cplant on a node.  It determines the line from
    the etc/cfg file (see cfg man page for its format) which is
    appropriate for the host <bf/cplant/ is being run on, then runs
    the scripts listed on that line with the arguments given on that
    line.  If <bf/start/ is given, the scripts are run in the order
    listed in the cfg file (start is given as the first argument to
    each script).  If <bf/stop/ is given, the scripts are run in the
    reverse order they are listed in the cfg file (stop is given as
    the first argument to each script).  If <bf/restart/ is given, it
    executes a stop sequence followed by a start sequence.

    The <bf/cplant/ script first looks for " disabled " lines, then
    regular lines, then " default " lines (see the <bf/cfg/ man page).
