<sect1> NAME
    <p>
CplantFamilyMap, CplantFamilyMapGrp
    </p>


<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/#include &lt;cplant.h>/
    </p>
    <p>
    <bf/int CplantFamilyMap(jobFamilyInfo */<it/job/<bf/, int */<it/nidmap/<bf/, int */<it/pidmap/<bf/, int /<it/len/<bf/)/

    <bf/int CplantFamilyMapGrp(jobFamilyInfo */<it/job/<bf/, int */<it/nidmap/<bf/, int */<it/pidmap/<bf/, int /<it/len/<bf/, int /<it/nMembers/<bf/, int */<it/rankList/<bf/, int /<it/tmout/<bf/)/
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    The function <bf/CplantFamilyMap/ returns physical node ID map and
    portals process ID map for the parallel application
    specified by <it/job/.  These maps are required in order to use
    the Cplant portals library to communicate with the application.
    The <it/job/ is a 
    handle returned by <bf/CplantSpawnJob/, <bf/CplantMyParent/
    or <bf/CplantMySelf/.  
    </p>
    <p>
    If <it/nidmap/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array of size <it/len/.
    <it/nidmap&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to the physical node ID of the process 
    with rank <it/p/.
    Similarly, if <it/pidmap/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array 
    of size <it/len/, and
    <it/pidmap&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to the portals process ID of the 
    rank <it/p/ process.
    </p>
    <p>
    The function <bf/CplantFamilyMapGrp/ is a collective call.
    Every process that participates in the
    request must make the call with the same list of participants.
    <it/nMembers/ is the number of processes participating in the call,
    <it/rankList/ is the list of participating process ranks, and <it/tmout/
    is the number of seconds to wait before judging a collective operation
    among the pariticpants to be a failure.  In our implementation of this
    call, the first process in the <it/rankList/ makes the request to <bf/yod2/
    and broadcasts the results to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
    If <it/nMembers/ is zero, or <it/rankList/ is NULL, then this is taken
    to mean that all processes in the application are participating.
    </p>
    

<sect1> RETURN VALUE
    <p>
     Both functions return -1 on error, and 0 on success.  
    </p>
