<sect1> NAME
    <p>
CplantFamilyTermination, CplantFamilyTerminationGrp
    </p>


<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/#include &lt;cplant.h>/
    </p>
    <p>
    <bf/int CplantFamilyTermination(jobFamilyInfo */<it/job/<bf/, int */<it/exitCode/<bf/, int */<it/termSig/<bf/, int */<it/terminator/<bf/, int */<it/done/<bf/, int /<it/len/<bf/)/

    <bf/int CplantFamilyTerminationGrp(jobFamilyInfo */<it/job/<bf/, int */<it/exitCode/<bf/, int */<it/termSig/<bf/, int */<it/terminator/<bf/, int */<it/done/<bf/, int /<it/len/<bf/, int /<it/nMembers/<bf/, int */<it/rankList/<bf/, int /<it/tmout/<bf/)/
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    The function <bf/CplantFamilyTermination/ returns termination information
    about the specified <it/job/.  <it/job/ is a 
    handle returned by <bf/CplantSpawnJob/, <bf/CplantMyParent/
    or <bf/CplantMySelf/.  
    </p>
    <p>
    If <it/done/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array of size <it/len/.
    <it/done&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to 1 if the process 
    with rank <it/p/ in the application has terminated, and 0
    if it has not.
    </p>
    <p>
    If <it/exitCode/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array of size
    <it/len/.  <it/exitCode&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to exit code of the 
    rank <it/p/ process.
    If <it/termSig/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array of size
    <it/len/ and  <it/termSig&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to the terminating signal,
    if any, of the rank <it/p/ process.
    If <it/terminator/ is not NULL, it is taken to point to an array of size
    <it/len/ and  <it/terminator&lsqb;p&rsqb;/ is set to one of 
    <bf/PCT_JOB_OWNER/ or <bf/PCT_ADMINISTRATOR/ respectively 
    if the process was aborted
    by the job's owner or by a system administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
    The function <bf/CplantFamilyTerminationGrp/ is a collective call.
    Every process that participates in the
    request must make the call with the same list of participants.
    <it/nMembers/ is the number of processes participating in the call,
    <it/rankList/ is the list of participating process ranks, and <it/tmout/
    is the number of seconds to wait before judging a collective operation
    among the pariticpants to be a failure.  In our implementation of this
    call, the first process in the <it/rankList/ makes the request to <bf/yod2/
    and broadcasts the results to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
    If <it/nMembers/ is zero, or <it/rankList/ is NULL, then this is taken
    to mean that all processes in the application are participating.
    </p>
    

<sect1> RETURN VALUE
    <p>
     Both functions return -1 on error, and 0 on success.  
    </p>
