The man page sources are the *.sgml files.  They produce *.3 man
pages. Many of them describe more than one function.  In order 
for "man someFunction" to find the man page for "someFunction" 
if the file it's in is not "someFunction.3", we need a
file "someFunction.3" which sources the file it's defined in.

So... If the NAME section of your sgml file names more than one function,
create a man page for each function (after the first) that sources 
that file.  Name the sgml file for the first function in the NAME section.

For example, CplantInterjobBarrier.sgml describes all these functions:

  CplantInterjobBarrier
  CplantInterjobBarrierGrp 
  CplantBarrierStatus
  CplantBarrierStatusGrp

So we have three files called 

  CplantInterjobBarrierGrp.3
  CplantBarrierStatus.3
  CplantBarrierStatusGrp.3

that each contain the single line:

  .so man3/CplantInterjobBarrier.3


It would be nice to write a script that is invoked by the 
makefile and produces these automatically from the .sgml files.
