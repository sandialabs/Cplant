<sect1> NAME
    <p>
CplantNodesRemaining
    </p>


<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
    <bf/#include &lt;cplant.h>/
    </p>
    <bf/int CplantNodesRemaining(void)/
    </p>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    The function <bf/CplantNodesRemaining/ only makes sense for
    PBS jobs.  It returns a count of the number of nodes allocated by
    PBS to the job, less the number of nodes in use by applications
    in the same family as the calling job.  A <it/family/ of jobs is
    all jobs started by a single Cplant application and it's descendants.
    Note that if your PBS script ran more than one invocation of
    <bf/yod/ or <bf/yod2/, the count is incomplete, as it does not
    include nodes in use by these other invocations.
    </p> 

<sect1> RETURN VALUE
    <p>
    This functions return -1 on error, and 0 on success.  
    </p>
