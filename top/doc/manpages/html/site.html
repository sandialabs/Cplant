 <P>
  Certain runtime configuration information required by yod, pct, and
bebopd can be set up in a text file.   For every item that can be defined
in the site file, there is also an environment variable that can define
this item, and there is a default coded into the Cplant utilities and daemons.
 Definition of the items at runtime procedes like this:  If there is an
environment value defining the item, this is the value used.  <BR>
 Else if there is a definition in the site file, this is the value used.
 <BR>
 Else the default coded into the utilities and daemons is used.   The format
of the site file is to list the environment variable name followed by the
definition of the environment variable.   Values that can be defined in
the site file or by way of environment variables are the following:  <P>

<DL>

<DT><I>PCT_SCRATCH</I>
</DT>
<DD>     <BR>
 The path name to a directory in RAM disk on the compute nodes where the
PCT will store the user's executable. Default: /tmp/pct-scratch  </DD>

<DT><I>PCT_OVERFLOW</I>
</DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name to local disk on the compute node where the PCT can store
user executables that don't fit in RAM disk.  A value CRnone tells the PCT
there is no disk storage for user executables. Default: none  </DD>

<DT><I>LOGFILENAME</I>
</DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The pathname from the service node to the user log file written by yod.
Default: /tmp/userlog  </DD>

<DT><I>VM_NAME_FILE</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The pathname (from compute and service nodes) to a text file containing
the name of the current virtual machine. Default: /cplant/etc/vmname  </DD>

<DT><I>PBS_PREFIX</I>
</DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The location of the <I>bin</I> and <I>sbin</I> directories containing PBS executables.
Default: /  </DD>
</DL>
<P>
   <BR>
 The following values are used by yod when it tries to load an executable
that is too large to fit in the compute node RAM disk.  yod instead copies
the executable to the SSS1, and then uses the SUID yod_site_priv to rsh
to SSS1 and rcp the executable to the SSS0's on SUs which contain compute
nodes of the job.  yod tells the PCTs the pathname to these copies of the
executable and the PCTs exec them from there.  (If all the compute nodes
of the job are in one SU, then yod just copies the executable to the SSS1
and tells the PCTs to exec it from there.)  A CR%s in these definitions
is replaced at runtime with the virtual machine name.  <P>

<DL>

<DT><I>VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE</I>
</DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name on the SSS1 to a directory where the executable will be
stored. Default: /usr/local/%s  </DD>

<DT><I>VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE_FROM_SRV_NODE</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name to VM_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the service nodes. Default: /etc/local
 </DD>

<DT><I>SU_GLOBAL_STORAGE</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name on the SSS0 to a directory where the executable will be
stored. Default: /cplant/nfs-cplant  </DD>

<DT><I>LOCAL_EXEC_PATH</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name to SU_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the compute node. Default: /cplant
 </DD>

<DT><I>SINGLE_LEVEL_GLOBAL_STORAGE</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name to global storage on the SSS1 from the service nodes. If
all the compute nodes of a job are in one SU, a single copy of the executable
will be made by yod to the directory on the SSS1. Default: /etc/local  </DD>

<DT><I>SINGLE_LEVEL_LOCAL_EXEC_PATH</I>
</DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The path name to SINGLE_LEVEL_GLOBAL_STORAGE from the compute nodes. Default:
/usr/local/%s  </DD>

<DT><I>SU_NAME_FORMAT</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 At runtime, an SU machine name is formed by replacing CR%d in this format
with the SU number.  It is the machine name used in the rcp from the SSS1
to the SSS0. Default: z-%d  </DD>

<DT><I>VM_GLOBAL_MACHINE</I> </DT>
<DD> <BR>
      <BR>
 The machine name of the SSS1, for yod's rsh from the service node. Default:
alaska-sss1-0 </DD>
</DL>
<P>
  The default location of the site file is CR/etc/local/site.
 This can be overridden at runtime with the environment variable SITE_FILE.
