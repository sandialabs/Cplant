  <B>cfg</B> -- Cplant node-configuration file 
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">Description</A></H2>
    <BR>
 <P>
  <B>cfg</B> is the file which the init.d/cplant script examines to determine
node configurations.  It contains lines of the format:  hostname [hostname2]...
: script[=args] [script[=args]]...  where hostname is the output of `hostname`
on a node in the cluster, and script[=args] is the name of a script in
cplant/init.d and the arguments that should be passed to it.    IMPORTANT:
due to the way cfg is parsed, all hostnames MUST BE padded with whitespace
on both sides.  Ie- even if there is only a single hostname listed, it must
have a space before and after it in order for the <B>cplant</B> script to identify
it correctly (ie-  no spaces, the line won't be matched and the node may
come up with the default configuration!).  There are three special configuration
cases:   1) a line with the string  default  before the colon instead of
a hostname list indicates the (default) configuration of any node(s) which
are not explicitly listed in the file.  This is typically used for compute
nodes, as their configuration is the same and they are (generally) the
most numerous type of node in the cluster.  Only the first default line
in the cfg file is significant.  2)  a line with the string  disabled  after
the colon instead of a script[=args] list identifies node(s) which are
disabled from the cplant perspective and should not attempt to start cplant.
 This is typically used to temporarily disable nodes with known hardware
problems etc.  There can be any number of disabled lines, as well as any
number of hostnames listed before the colon of such a line.  3) the third
case is a line which has  bebopd_arguments  before the colon.  after the
colon should appear the verbatim arguments that should be given to bebopd
when it is run (by the init.d/user_env script in the event that it is run
with bebopd as an argument).  This appears in the cfg file in order to remove
it from the user_env which should be cluster-independant (and the arguments
can easily be too long and problematic to deal with as the regular script=args
format).
