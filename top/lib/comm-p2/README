This is the server library, containing the communication and group
formation routines used by bebopd, yod, pct etc.  It uses the Portals
2 interface to the network.

In 11/2000 the API was changed so that functions names are more
consistent and so that none of the Portals 2 objects are exposed 
to the caller.  (The caller previously had to know what a 
PORTAL_INDEX and a CHAMELEON were.  These don't exist in Portals 3.)
These changes were made because it makes a better library, and
also so that the API for the Portals 3 version of the server library 
will be the same.

The script fixLibsrvrAPI in this directory converts codes that used
the original API so that they use the new one.  Some things that may
need to be fixed by hand:

o Matchbit fields are unsigned long, not CHAMELEON.  The script will
  change "CHAMELEON" to "unsigned long".  But if you were referencing
  CHAMELEON fields in your code you need to rewrite that by hand.

o The control_msg_handle fields differ in the Portals 3 version of the
  library.  Use the accessor functions in srvr_comm_ctl.h to access the
  fields.

o Before passing a control_msg_handle structure to 
  srvr_get_next_control_msg, clear it with SRVR_CLEAR_HANDLE.  (The
  fields now may be used to select the next message to get, so
  you don't want garbage in there.)
