These tests were created by Don Moore to test Cplant utilities.

ts_srvr_ctl, ts_srvr_put, ts_srvr_get:

These tests (the sources are in top/compute/test/current/general)
use the comm routines in libsrvr.a.  The routines were 
designed for cplant distributed servers (PCTs) and client/servers
(yod/bebopd), but can be used by Cplant apps as well.  In fact, the 
app pre-main startup protocol uses these functions to get data from 
the PCT, and the IO protocol through yod/fyod uses it as well.

In this directory the tests are built as Cplant servers.  In the
top/compute/test/current/general directory, they are built as
Cplant apps.  We want to be sure the tests work in both runtime
environments.

Don't "install" these.  The tests in the installation directory
are the Cplant application versions.

ts_srvr_coll_comm:

This test tests the server library's group membership and group
collective communication operations.  It should be built (in this
directory) and run as a standalone server.

yod2:

This guy tests the job initialization/service/termination functions in
libjob.a.
