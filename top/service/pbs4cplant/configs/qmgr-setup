The node on which the bebopd is running must be set up to send qmgr
commands.  So it must have the local PBS runtime directory and access
to client executables.
 
The first time the server is run, it only accepts manager commands from
root on the machine it is running on.  It compares the string in
PBS_HOME/PBSserver to the name of the host on the incoming command.  If
they don't match exactly, the request is rejected.  So it may be
neccesary to add or remove a domain name from the name in PBSserver
so that these very first commands may be submitted by root on the
machine the server is running on.
 
The server's acl_hosts attribute should list every node from which
requests will be received.  Again, it has to match exactly the
hostname on the incoming request.
 
The server's manager attribute must include root on the node on which
the bebopd is running, because the bebopd submits qmgr commands to
set the resources_available.size.
