These are the configuration files for the Cplant prime/nonprime
policy.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

At runtime, the behavior of PBS is determined by the configuration
files in the working directory.

This directory contains the runtime configuration files that are
particular to PBS/Cplant and also the commands to set up the PBS
server the first time it is run against a given working directory.

On Cplant/alaska, we keep a template of the working directory in
/usr/local/pbs/working.  From there it can be copied onto each
service node at /tmp/pbs/working.  (This pathname is compiled into
the PBS codes.)  The nodes hosting PBS clients and daemons must
have this working directory.  The node hosting the bebopd must
also have it, since the bebopd invokes the qmgr client to keep
the PBS server up to date on the number of compute nodes in the machine.

qmgr-setup -

  This file contains the qmgr commands to be supplied to the
  PBS server the first time it is run against a particular
  working directory.  The server saves the values in the working
  directory, so they don't need to be re-entered the next time
  the server is started.

  When running the server for the first time with a working directory,
  run:

     pbs_server -t create

  Then enter the qmgr commands in this file.  When starting the server
  subsequently, it is started without arguments.

  Read the comments in the file before entering the commands.

mom_priv/config

  This is the PBS MOMs configuration file.  If you send the pbs_mom
  process a SIGHUP, it will re-read this file.  (The PBS MOM runs
  on each service node and is the process that starts user scripts
  and monitors them to ensure they don't run over their allotted
  time.)

  Entries:

  $clienthost - Every service node should be listed here.  The MOM
    will only accept messages from these hosts.

  $usecp - When a PBS job terminates, the PBS MOM copies it's stdout
    and stderr streams to a file in the directory from which the
    job was submitted.  It will use it's own version of rcp (which
    often fails on alaska) unless told with this directive to use
    cp. This first field is the remote file path, the second is
    the local file path to which the files can be copied with cp.

  $cplant_grace - If a PBS jobs runs over its allotted walltime
    limit and there are jobs waiting to run, the PBS MOM will
    kill the over-limit job.  If cplant_grace is set to some
    positive value, the MOM will allow that many seconds grace
    period before killing the job.  If cplant_grace is zero,
    MOM will kill the job as soon as it notices it is over-limit.
    If cplant_grace is negative, MOM will not kill jobs.

sched_priv/holidays

   This file must list the prime and non-prime time periods, and
   every official holiday in the year.

sched_priv/resource_group

   This file must list every user allowed to submit jobs to PBS.
   The format is 

      name   unique ID    group   priority

   Users may be grouped into workgroups which are assigned a
   priority among other groups.  The base group is called root.

sched_priv/usage

   This file is written by the scheduler to keep track of user's
   time on the machine.  It is used by the fairshare calculations.
   It should be 0 length with permissions 644.

sched_priv/dedicated_time

   If you have dedicated time, it should be listed in here.  Queues
   with names beginning "ded" are the only queues allowed to run
   jobs during dedicated time.

server_priv/nodes

   The "nodes" resource of PBS in our case refers to the service
   nodes on which the MOMs run.  List each service node and append
   it with ":ts", indicating that it is timeshared.  (More than
   one PBS script can be executing on a service node at any given
   time.)
