#  This script sets up the necessary environment to configure the PBS
#  distribution prior to building it.
#
#  It assumes that the machine on which you are building PBS has a file
#  system which will be accessible by the nodes running the PBS binaries,
#  and that the absolute path names to this file system are the same on
#  build machine and on the target machines.  If this is not the case, you
#  can configure one way before you "make" the code (with pathnames relative
#  to the target machine) and another way before you "install" the code
#  (this time with pathnames relative to the build machine). 
#

#
# The PBS server runs on one service node in the vm.  The PBS commands
# and MOM run on any service node in the vm.  All three will access configuration
# files and write log files to the PBS_HOME area defined in this file.
