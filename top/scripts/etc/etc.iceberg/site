The code in service/util/bebopd/config.c searches the site file 
for definition names.  It takes the subsequent text on the line 
as the value of the definition.  So don't include the definition 
names in comments.  And no special character is interpreted
as starting a comment.  If someone wants to make the parsing 
of the site file fancier, go ahead.

yod and friends operate this way:  If a definition name is
defined in it's environment, that is the value used.  Otherwise
if it is defined in this site file, that is the value used.
Otherwise the default in config.c is used.

# On some Cplants, the application executable file is stored
# in RAM disk on the compute nodes.  Sometimes it doesn't fit
# there, so yod tries to copy it to a file system mounted
# by the compute nodes.  For scalability, it is copied to a
# global file system, and from there to a file system local
# to each scalable unit.  If all the compute nodes are in 
# one scalable unit, the executable is just copied to the
# global file system.  These paths indicate how to copy to
# these file systems.  A %s in these path names will be
