Release Date: Nov 5, 2002 

Here are some highlights of 2.0 changes since our last 1.0 public release:

   of available nodes per job)
 - Steamlined and efficient scalable job load protocol
 - Dramatic robustness increases in system daemons and network protocols
 - Multiple-server scalable I/O proxy daemon (ENFS)
 - Support for Alpha, x86, IA64 architectures running 2.2 and 2.4
   Linux kernels
