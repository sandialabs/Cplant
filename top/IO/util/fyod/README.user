The files system made available by FYOD is addressed as 

	/raid_xxi/tmp/your_file_or_directory_name

where i is either zero or one and xx is a number between 01 and 06.
For example, /raid_010/tmp/file1.
(This is a file name so /raid_10/tmp/xyz, will not open a file on 
unit 10, /raid_010/tmp.)

For now, to create the directory, or to moved files to or from the 
external world requires logging on to the Service node,  xxxxxxxx,
which is attached to the I/O subsystem.   All of the /raid_xxi files
systems are NFS mounted there.


The presently available units are
	/raid_010/tmp
	/raid_020/tmp
	/raid_030/tmp
	/raid_040/tmp
	/raid_050/tmp
	/raid_060/tmp
