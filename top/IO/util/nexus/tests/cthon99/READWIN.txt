Notes for DOS/Windows.

The basic tests and some of the special tests have been ported to run
under DOS and Windows.  Each set of tests has "console", "dos", and
"scripts" subdirectories.

The "console" and "dos" subdirectories have batch files and makefiles
for building the 32-bit and 16-bit executables, respectively.

The makefiles can be imported into Visual C++ as "external" makefiles.
Alternatively, a batch file is provided to build the tests using the
nmake command line utility.

The "scripts" subdirectory has scripts for running the tests (some
batch files, some MS-Test 2.0 .mst files, and some Perl scripts)

The tests have not been rebuilt in a DOS or Windows environment since
they were last edited, though the basic tests were known to build
under Windows not long ago.  If you need to make changes to build the
tests under your environment, you are welcome to send your changes to
the person named in the README file, and we will incorporate them into
the master distribution.

If you port additional tests to DOS/Windows, please send your changes
to the person named in the README file, so that we can incorporate
your changes into the master distribution.

Note that we keep a single set of sources for DOS, Windows, and
assorted Unix variants, so please isolate DOS-specific or
Windows-specific code with appropriate ifdefs.
