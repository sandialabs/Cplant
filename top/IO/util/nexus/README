BUGS

libc:nis & libc:nisplus

Under RedHat 6.1 (at least) NIS and NISPLUS attempt to free() a buffer
that was not previously malloc'd. While malloc (and electric fence) don't
seem to mind, the allocator used here does. Since we don't run NIS we
usually disable it. It might be that this only occurs when the nsswitch.conf
specifies that NIS or NISPLUS be used but that it's not really enabled. If
that's so, please let us know.

The workaround, for us, is to remove all mention of NIS and NISPLUS from
the nsswitch.conf file.
