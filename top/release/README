guidelines for building a release
---------------------------------
0) tag the release repositry; do

      % cvs rtag WHATEVER-RELEASE-TAG top-release 

    to tag the tree specified as "top-release"
    in CVSROOT/modules.

   (or something like this -- we've been tagging
    partial trees, so familiarize yourself with
    the correct tag procedure)

1) do "cvs co -r WHATEVER-RELEASE-TAG top-release"
   to check out everything required in a release
   "top-release" is the name of a module that is
   supposed to include everything we want (see
   $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/modules); despite the name,
   it should checkout into ./top.

2) in top/release do "make src_release" to build
   a source release, which probably gets put in
   CPLANT_TOP/../top-release

3) use THAT source tree to build the Cplant binaries
   (this is sort of important because sometimes checking
   out a tagged tree will omit some important part of
   the directory structure -- yielding a corrupted source
   tree, i.e. one whose compilation needs to be debugged)

      move the source release dir to CPLANT_TOP, 

      build the mcp (using "cvs co -r WHATEVER-RELEASE-TAG mcp" 
      on a sparc or x86) 

      build the kernel (follow the README in 
        top/compute/OS/linux-patches/linux-x.y.z)

      do "Make basic; Make basic install"
        in CPLANT_TOP to get the "basic" binaries


      hopefully, the Makefile in 
      top/compute/OS/linux-patches/KERNEL_VERSION has been
      set up to install a kernel in Cplant/alpha-linux/kernels
      and that patch directory is listed in makefiles/Makefile-basic
      so that the "Make basic install" above gets the kernel...

      else

      copy the kernel (bootpfile in linux/arch/alpha/boot) to
      Cplant/alpha-linux/kernels/vmlinux.compute

4) after maybe testing the binaries, use bin_release 
   target in top/release/makefile to make the binary tar ball
   -- call it Cplant-x.y.bin.tar.gz

5) tar up the src release as well
   -- copy the rtsmcp to the src tree's top/compute/OS/Myrinet/MCP;
      this will make building from the source tree so much easier...
      
   -- may want to remove some things from this, like 
      top/support/cplant which has the nfs root...
   -- call it Cplant-x.y.src.tar.gz
