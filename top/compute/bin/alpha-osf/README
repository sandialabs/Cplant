top/compute/bin/alpha-osf/README
----------------------------------

Prior to this README there were a couple of empty directories 
in our Cplant repository which created a problem when tagging 
the repository for release and then checking out the tag. The 
empty directories do not show up in the checkout: 

top/compute/bin/alpha-linux
top/compute/bin/alpha-osf
