top/compute/OS/linux-patches/linux-2.0.35/README.

This directory contains the Cplant "patch" for the 
linux 2.0.35 kernel.

The Cplant patch is a NO_PTL_SYSCALL item -- a minimal
patch w/o support for portals syscalls and other things.

---
The Cplant patch for axp 2.0.35 is really a tar file.
It uses the axp-patched kernel from the dec site:

   ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/
         alpha-sources-2.0.35-0.2.tar.gz

    1) obtain and unarchive the above package in the
       same directory that has this README:

          % tar xvfz alpha-sources*

    2) apply the Cplant patch from this dir:

          % tar xvf axp-2035.tar

    3) move the resulting directory and set up the linux
       link:

          % cd ../..           (cd to top/compute/OS)
          % ln -s linux-patches/linux-2.0.35/axplinux-2.0.35-0.2 linux

       i.e. top/compute/OS/linux should point to top/compute/
       OS/linux-patches/linux-2.0.35/axpl* which should have the 
       kernel you just patched.
