top/compute/OS/linux-patches/linux-2.2.10/README.

NEW: Automated build of the linux kernel is now
supported via "make" and "make install"
in this directory. This requires access to the 
KERNEL_LOC location as defined in ./Makefile.
If the host you are building on does not have
access to this location, then linux-2.2.10.tar.gz 
should be copied to another location and KERNEL_LOC in
./Makefile should be modified accordingly. 
Also, to get the right linux config file,
TARGET in top/Makefile-common should be set accordingly. 
Currently supported values are SIBERIA, ALASKA and
X86-GENERIC, with
ALASKA being the default in Makefile-common.

This directory contains the Cplant "patch" for the 
linux 2.2.10 kernel.

The Cplant patch is pretty minimal,
w/o support for portals syscalls and other things.
We just hack a small handful of kernel files.

axp
---
The Cplant patch for axp 2.2.x is really a tar file.
It uses the stock kernel from the standard sites:

   http://www.sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/v2.2/
           linux-2.2.x.tar.gz

    1) obtain and unarchive the above package in the
       same directory that has this README:

          % tar xvfz linux-2*.tar.gz

    2) apply the Cplant patch from this dir:

          % tar xvf axp-2.2.x.tar

    3) set up the linux link in Cplant/top/compute/OS:

          % cd ../..         
          % ln -s linux-patches/linux-2.2.x/linux linux

       i.e. top/compute/OS/linux should point to top/compute/
       OS/linux-patches/linux-2.2.x/linux which should have the 
       kernel you just patched.

    4) there is a linux/config.ALASKA file if you actually want
       to configure and/or build the kernel.


issues
------
There are some issues I ran into in running Cplant on 2.2 kernels.

1) on booting a node, portmap service needs to start BEFORE the
   nfs mounts, i.e., /etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap should run before
   /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfsfs. the way this is controlled on a redhat
   machine is that the links /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/SXXportmap and
   /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/SYYnfsnfs should have XX < YY.

2) in setting up routes in scripts, include the netmask when doing 
   /sbin/route:

     /sbin/route add -net 192.168.254.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw boothost

not just

     /sbin/route add -net 192.168.254.0 gw boothost

for instance.

3) i do NOT believe that the tulip driver needs to be modified with
   the REVERSE_PROBE_ORDER or media choice hacks. also, the de4x5
   driver seems to work well on the dual ethernet interface service
   nodes
