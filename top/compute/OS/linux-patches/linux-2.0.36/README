top/compute/OS/linux-patches/linux-2.0.36/README.

This directory contains a Cplant "patch" for the 
linux 2.0.36 X86 kernel.

There is NO axp patch for the 2.0.36 kernel.

Would have just done 2.0.35 for the x86 but that
kernel has problems recognizing more than 64 MB
of host memory...my experience anyway.

The Cplant patch is a NO_PTL_SYSCALL item -- a minimal
patch w/o support for portals syscalls and other things.


x86
---

The Cplant patch for x86 2.0.36 is really a tar file.
It uses the stock kernel from sunsite:

   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernels/v2.0
         linux-2.0.36.tar.gz

    1) obtain and unarchive the above package in the
       same directory that has this README:

          % tar xvfz linux-2.0.36.tar.gz

    2) apply the Cplant patch from this dir:

          % tar xvf x86-2036.tar

    3) move the resulting directory and set up the linux
       link:

          % cd ../..           (cd to top/compute/OS)
          % ln -s linux-patches/linux-2.0.36/linux linux

       i.e. top/compute/OS/linux should point to top/compute/
       OS/linux-patches/linux-2.0.36/linux which should have the 
       kernel you just patched.
