- This module is not kept backward compatible with 2.0.x kernels
- For now we expect the Portals 2.0 module to be there. We want it
    to be inserted first, since rtscts.mod (and pkt.mod) depends
    on it, and the IP module depends in turn on the rtscts module.

    We make p3.mod dependent on portals.mod and therefore establish
    a clear order and can let protals.mod install and remove
    /proc/cplant.
