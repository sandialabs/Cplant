eeprom --  o a myrinet utility like Myricom's l3prom for reading
             the lanai eeprom. 

           o they only provide a binary, whereas we may find the
             source useful. 

           o this version asks for a copy of the eeprom structure
             from a new LinuxDevice.a library routine, 
             get_lanai_eeprom_linux(),
             which is a hack of open_lanai_device_linux() and which
             I added to ../lib/LinuxDevice.c
