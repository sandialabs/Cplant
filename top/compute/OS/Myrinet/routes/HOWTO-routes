This file describes how to generate routes for Siberia. This is an
off-line procedure and does not require booting the machine with GM to
use the Myricom mapper. The algorithm used is the same as the one
built into the mapper, though.

The file top/support/cplant/Documentation/HowToMapMyrinet describes
how to do it using GM.

gensiberia (in this directory) has hard-coded the topology and
numbering and naming scheme of Siberia in it. It creates a mapper file
for Siberia, just like the GM mapper would.

Using Myricom's simple_routes program that comes with GM, we generate
a route file with all the routes from all the nodes in it.

myr2sandia (in this directory) takes the Myricom route file generated
above and converts it into a set of routes files. There will be one
route file for each node, and the format is such that my MCP can
understand it.


    - gensiberia > siberia.map
    - get the latest GM source and untar it. Assume it is in the
	directory gm-1.086
    - cd gm-1.086/mt
    - make
	If it says makefile:4: ../config/make.<arch>: No such file or
	directory, then you'll have to create a Makefile for your
	architecture. Often you can just copy one of the existing ones:
	cd config
	cp make.<similar arch> make.<arch>
	For example "cp make.intel_linux make.sparc_linux"
    - cd tools/<arch>
    - simple_routes siberia.map stdout -route-args | myr2sandia siberia

If the program simple_routes is installed somewhere on $PATH, then
the Makefile in this directory will build the Siberia tools and
generate the routes.

The Makefile in this directory does all of the above for siberia, tinyplant,
and iceberg2:

    make
    make routes
