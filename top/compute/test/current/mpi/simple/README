Some very simple MPI tests (that don't even have command line options).
They are so simple that one can easily determine by a quick look at the
code if they are doing the right thing...

baby -- find out MPI size and rank, and print them out. 
        this can be run as any number of processes.

two  -- two processes exchange messages. must be run as
        exactly two (hence the name, "four") processes.
        each process should receive a 0 from the other one.

pc   -- producer/consumer; producer sends 100 messages to
        the consumer. must be run as two processes.

ring -- pass a token around a ring and increment its value
        at each hop. when it gets back to the first guy
        check its value. 
        can be run with any number of processes.
