We want the DEC Tru 64 fortran message catalog available to fortran
applications at run time, for OSF compiled codes. A different message
catalog is needed for Compaq Linux compiled codes.

The NLSPATH setting used to locate the catalog is selected at compile
time in startup.c, and exported into the application environment at
runtime. The defaults are /cplant/lib/linux or /cplant/lib/osf as
appropriate.

Developers are asked to note when for_msg.cat changes with new
releases of Tru 64 libraries, or of Compaq Linux compilers, and put
the new version in the repository.
