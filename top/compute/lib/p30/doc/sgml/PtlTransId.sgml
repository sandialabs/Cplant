<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/PtlTransId/ &mdash Translate the id of the current process

<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
     #include "p30.h"

     int PtlTransId( ptl_process_id_t* id );

<sect1> PARAMETERS
    <p>
     <descrip>
     <tag /id/
     On successful return, this location will hold the id for the calling
     expressed as both a <bf /PTL_ADDR_NID/ type and a <bf /PTL_ADDR_GID/
     type.
     </descrip>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    Processes that use the Portals API, can be identified using a node id
    and process id.  Every node in the computing system has a unique node
    identifier and every process running on a node has a unique process
    identifier.  As such, any process in the computing system can be
    identified by its node id and process id.  Processes can also be
    identified using a group id and rank id.  When a portals job is
    loaded, it is given a unique group identifier. In addition, each
    process in the job is assigned a unique rank id starting at zero.

    The Portals API defines a type, <bf /ptl_process_id_t/ for
    representing process ids using either or both of the schemes.
    <bf /PtlTransId/ translates addresses between the two schemes.
    <bf /ptl_process_id_t/ is defined as:
<code>
typedef enum { PTL_ADDR_NID, PTL_ADDR_GID, PTL_ADDR_BOTH } ptl_addr_kind_t;

typedef struct {
    ptl_addr_kind_t addr_kind;   /* kind of address pair */
    ptl_id_t        nid, pid;    /* node id, process id  */
    ptl_id_t        gid, rid;    /* group id, rank id    */
} ptl_process_id_t;
</code>

<sect1> RETURN VALUES
    <p>
    <descrip>
    <tag /PTL_OK/
    Indicates success
    <tag /PTL_NOINIT/
    Indicates that the Portals API has not been successfully initialized
    <tag /PTL_SEGV/
    Indicates that \texttt{id} is not a legal address
    <tag /PTL_ADDR_UNKNOWN/
    Indicates that the address could not be translated.
