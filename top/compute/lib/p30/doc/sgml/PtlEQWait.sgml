<sect1> NAME
    <p>
    <bf/PtlEQWait/ &mdash Wait for the next event in an event queue

<sect1> SYNOPSIS
    <p>
     #include "p30.h"

     int PltEQWait( ptl_handle_eq_t eventq, ptl_event_t *event );

<sect1> PARAMETERS
    <p>
     <descrip>
     <tag /eventq/
     event queue handle
     <tag /event/
     on successful return, this location will hold the values
     associated with the next event in the event queue
     </descrip>

<sect1> DESCRIPTION
    <p>
    <bf /PtlEQWait/ blocks the calling process (thread) until there is
    an event in an event queue.  This function also returns the next
    event in the event queue and removes this event from the queue.
    This is the only blocking operation in the Portals 3.0 API.

    <p>
    The <bf /ptl_event_t/ is defined as:
<code>
typedef struct {
    ptl_event_kind_t      type;
    ptl_process_id_t      initiator;
    ptl_pt_index_t        portal;
    ptl_match_bits_t      match_bits;
    ptl_size_t            rlength;
    ptl_size_t            mlength;
    ptl_size_t            offset;
    ptl_md_t              mem_desc;
} ptl_event_t;
</code>

<sect1> RETURN VALUES
    <p>
    <descrip>
    <tag /PTL_OK/
     success
    <tag /PTL_EQ_DROPPED/
     indicates success (i.e., an event is returned) and that at least one
     event between this event and the last event obtained (using <bf /PtlEQGet/
     or <bf /PtlEQWait/) from this event queue has been dropped due to limited
     space in the event queue
    <tag /PTL_NOINIT/
     the Portals API has not been successfully initialized
    <tag /PTL_INV_EQ/
    <bf /eventq/ is not a valid event queue handle
    <tag /PTL_SEGV/
    <bf /event/ is not a legal address
    </descrip>
